# Doctors Appointments

The perfect entry-level Java Tool for a medical office!

Features:
- Adding new custom doctors, patients (and appointments);
- Editing existing doctors, patients (and appointments);
- Removing former doctors, patients (and outdated appointments);
- Showing Lists of custom doctors, patients and appointments added by user.

# 100% Java Core

Used: Encapsulation, Conditionals, Lists, Getters & Setters, and many more!

# How to use

!As a backend-only program, you have to open the code in a Java IDE to run (preferably IntelliJ IDEA)!

1. Run the main method by left-clicking on the green play button in the upper right corner (or by pressing Shift + F10);

2. The program should start, you have to use the specific key number which corresponds to the menu you want to enter in.

To do that, you'd want to enter the number in the running window from the keyboard. 

(ex > You want to navigate from main menu to Doctors management, so you'll have to simply type " 1 " in the opened dialog box);

# Notes

The program is not currently using a file or a database to store the custom added objects, so the doctors, patients,
and appointments should disappear when going back to main menu.

This is the very first version of a beginner CRUD program, so it'll receive further updates!

You can send bug reports to **akraaam003@gmail.com**, it'd be very helpful!
